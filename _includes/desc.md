Features:

* **Quick setup of jiggle bones**
* **PBD based integrator**
* **Constraints for stretch, volume and shape**
* **Test mode for real time preview of the simulation**
* **Animation baking**
* **Jiggle bone control** (Experimental)

Limitations:

* **Currently not supported jiggle effect of rotation about bone axis**
* **Simulation behavior is dependent on the frame rate**
