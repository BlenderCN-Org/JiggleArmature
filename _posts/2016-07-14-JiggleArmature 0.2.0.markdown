We are workin on the new [0.2.0 version](https://github.com/cheece/JiggleArmature/tree/0.2.0).

the new features in this version will be:

* **Copy jiggle bone properties** for quickly setting jiggle bone in many bones 
* **Time steping** for supporting higher forces and reduce simulation error

(more features will be added to this list...)
