We are working on the new [0.2.0 version](https://github.com/cheece/JiggleArmature/tree/0.2.0).

the new features in this version will be:

* **Copy jiggle bone properties** for quickly setting many jiggle bones
* **Integration sub-steps** for supporting stronger forces and reduce simulation error
* **Bone control parameter** for controlling jiggle bones with the blender animation system
* **Multiple bug fixes**

(more features will be added to this list...)
