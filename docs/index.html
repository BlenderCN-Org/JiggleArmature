<p>In order to enable jiggle bone first enable Jiggle Armature on the Armature panel, then
enable Jiggle Bone on the bones you want to be jiggly.
Test mode is enabled by default and allows you to test the behaviour without baking,
but be careful, if you have automatic keyframing enabled in blender the simulation
will be recorded and you will need to remove the recorded keyframes manually
